> can run millions of instructions per second (MIPS)
> Highly secured, process large workloads , continuous availability
> Can process multiple jobs , users at a time
> Used for large transactions
> Greater security & availability
> recent mainframes are a size of a refrigeratoe

features: (RAS)
> reliability
> availability
> seviceable
> Scalable
> compatibility

> can run multiple OS at the same time
> Os that runs on system 360 s/360 is called OS/360
> current version of mainframe is Z system , which runs on z/OS


languages in mainframe
> JCL (Job Control Languate) - it's a scripting language
> Application languages- COBOL, FOTRAN, C, C++, JAVA, REXX
> CICS (Customer Information Control Syatem)- front end for mainframe   
> Databses -- DB2, IMS
> File Access methos- VSAM
> OS -> Z/ OS, Linux

Data processing:
> Batch processing -- written in JCL 
    execution of a series of program without manual intervention
    runs during the batch window
> Online transaction processing(OLTP) -- CICS is used for OLTP
