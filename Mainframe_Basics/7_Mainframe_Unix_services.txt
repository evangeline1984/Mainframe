oedit & obrowse
>tso omvs --> to go to unix
    > oedit <dataset_name>  --> creates a new file in home directory
    > just "oedit" will list the unix directory list 
    > obrowse <dataset> --> browses the DS
    > just "obrowse" will list the files in the directory 
    > exit -> to come out of omvs session 
> can directly run as "tso oedit <ds_name>" without a session
