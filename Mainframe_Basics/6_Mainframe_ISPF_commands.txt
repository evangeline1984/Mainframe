    Retrieve command:
    -> keys --> assign a key to retrieve command
        --> to see the history of last executed commands
    nretrieve --> gives the last pds that we accessed

    compress a PDS 
    - if we delete a member in a PDS, the space oocupied by the member will not get released. So, give the option "z" in frontof the PDS to compress/release the deleted file's space 
    - compress is only for PDS and not for ps. It frees all the mpty space

    PDSE
    - for allocating a PDSE, just give the "Data set name type" as "LIBRARY" during allocation
    - PDSE manages the space automatically, no need to compress like PDS
    - to create a new PDS member from a aexisting member, goto edit mode in the existing DS , select the lines where you want to copy in the new file and in command"
        >create newmember
    - to copy all the lines from a current member to new member
        > create .zf .zl newmember

    - if you don't know the commands for a the member sin a PDS, just give "/", it will show the list of commands for the members
