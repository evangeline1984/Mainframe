Dataset:
 - its a record , specific portion is called field
 - in z OS , files are record-oriented
 - CR/LF not required in Z/oS

Dataset naming rules
 - qualifiers 
    eg: evan.prod.file --> 3 qualifiers.
    shd not end with .
    shd not contain an _
    shd not start with numerics
    shd not be more than 8 characters
    shd have only #$@ special characters
    shd have only the lenght of 44 including .

to create a dataset
1. logon
2. tso
3. option 3 -> utilities
4. option 2- dataset 
5. A -- for allocating

naming conventions:
Project.Group.Type
type:
 - jcl/job/cntl - jcl jobs
 - coblib - cobal library
 - proclib/proc/prc - procedures
 - loadlib - exdcutables

Types of dataset:
- physical sequence (PS)
- partition (PDS)
- partition data set extended 
- Generation Data Group (GDG)
- VSAM Datset- PS can be accessed only sequencially, to overcome that we have VSAM 

PS - file
PDS - folder

Create new PS & PDS
- Logical record lenght 
    eg: name,+ mobile #,+ age =88
- Block size
    eg: if given 88, then only 1 record will be read, if 88*10=880, then 10 records will be read at a time
- Space
    - primary quantity = space durig dataset allocation eg: 10
    - secondary quantity = when primary is filled , then secondary will be allocated for 15 times
- Space unit - KB (T, C, B)
- Average record lenght- (M, K, U)
- Record format - fb(fixed block) ie: every line is same length
- Directory Blocks- 0 means ps , non-zero value means its a directory
- Dataset name type - blank for PS /  PDS / LIBRARY for PDSE 

create a dataset:
>allocate dataset(test.evan.ps) tracks space(2,1) recfm(f) lrecl(80) dsorg(ps)
list the file:
>listds test.evan.ps

evan.test.jcl
evan.testcopy.jcl

COPY:
copy dataset from ps to ps
 - COpy the dataset from one to another means, the contents just gets appended.
copy dataset frok ps to PDS
 - cannot append to the existing member, only have to create a new member to copy from ps to pds. 
 - have to enable the / replace member option 
 - cannot append content from ps to pds
copy from pds to ps
 - data gets appended at the dest ps file 
copy from pds to pds member
  - has to be replaced or has to be copied to new member

MOVE:
ps to ps
  - dataset got appended from source to dest. Source file gets deleted
ps to pds
  - can be replaced & not appended (same as copy)

Compare files:
compare extended:

Search Datsets:
 - search for a file with a qulaifier name 
 - serach for data inside a dataset 

Edit/View/Browse datasets
edit- edit & save  "e" in front of dataset 
View- Edit but can't save "v" in front of dataset 
browse - obly view "b" in front of dataset
